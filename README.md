# ðŸŽ¨ Color Detection with HuskyLens and Arduino

## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea
This project uses the **HuskyLens AI Camera** and an **Arduino Uno** to recognize colors in real-time and print their names to the Serial Monitor.  
The goal is to explore color recognition using AI without complex training or coding â€” just plug and play with HuskyLens!

## ðŸ“¸ HuskyLens Modes

The **HuskyLens** supports several AI-powered modes, including:

- **Face Recognition** â€“ Detects and recognizes faces
- ![Face Recognition](face.jpg)
- **Object Tracking** â€“ Tracks learned objects.
- ![Object Traking](ObjectTraking.jpg)
- **Color Recognition** â€“ Detects and identifies trained colors.
- ![color Recognition](test1.jpg)
- **Object Classification** â€“ Classifies objects using ML models.

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. On the HuskyLens, switch to **Color Recognition** mode.
2. Train it to recognize red and green objects by using the "Learn" button.
3. Upload the Arduino code.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to see detected color IDs and actions.

At the beginning, we trained the HuskyLens to recognize 3 colors:

- **ID 1** â†’ Yellow  
- **ID 2** â†’ Green  
- **ID 3** â†’ Blue  

Once the training was complete, the HuskyLens would return the corresponding ID when it detects a color.
